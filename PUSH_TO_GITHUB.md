# Push to GitHub - Quick Steps

Your local repository is ready! Follow these steps to push to GitHub:

## Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website (Easiest)

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit https://github.com/new

2. **Create the repository**:
   - Repository name: `job-aggregation-api` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `Multi-source job aggregation API with REST endpoints`
   - Visibility: Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **After creating**, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/job-aggregation-api.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (If you have it installed)

If you install GitHub CLI later, you can use:

```bash
gh repo create job-aggregation-api --public --source=. --description "Multi-source job aggregation API" --push
```

## Current Status

## After Pushing

Once pushed, you can:

   cd job-aggregation-api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python job_server.py
   ```

2. **Access from other projects**:
   ```python
