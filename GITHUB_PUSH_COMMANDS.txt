# Commands to push to GitHub

# Step 1: Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository named "job-aggregation-api"
# - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
# - Make it Public or Private (your choice)

# Step 2: After creating the repo, run these commands in your terminal:

git remote add origin https://github.com/mfish324/job-aggregation-api.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# If your username is different, replace "mfish324" with your GitHub username

# That's it! Your code will be on GitHub and accessible from any project.
