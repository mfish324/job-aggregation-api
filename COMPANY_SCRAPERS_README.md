## Advantages Over Job Boards

### Why Scrape Companies Directly?

1. **Latest Positions** - Get jobs as soon as companies post them
2. **No Middleman** - Direct from source, no job board fees
3. **Complete Information** - Full job descriptions, not summaries
4. **Official Links** - Apply directly on company site
5. **Better Quality** - Verified, legitimate positions
6. **Salary Info** - Many companies include salary ranges (Google does!)

## Technical Details

### File: `company_scrapers.py`

Contains scraper classes for each company:
- `GoogleCareersScraper` - XML feed parser
- `AmazonCareersScraper` - API client
- `AppleCareersScraper` - API client
- `MicrosoftCareersScraper` - API client
- `MetaCareersScraper` - Web scraper
- `TeslaCareersScraper` - API client

All scrapers inherit from `BaseScraper` and implement:
- `scrape(keywords, location, max_pages)` method
- Keyword filtering
- Location filtering
- Data normalization
- Error handling

### Integration with Aggregator

The company scrapers are automatically added to `JobAggregator`:

```python
from aggregator import JobAggregator

# Initialize aggregator (includes all company scrapers)
agg = JobAggregator()

# Scrape Google only
stats = agg.scrape_all(sources=['google'], max_pages=1)

# Scrape all FAANG
stats = agg.scrape_all(sources=['google', 'amazon', 'apple', 'meta'], max_pages=3)
```

## Rate Limiting

Company scrapers respect rate limits:
- 2-second delay between page requests
- Timeouts: 30-60 seconds
- Retry logic for failed requests
- US-based job filtering to reduce API calls

## Troubleshooting

### Company Scraper Not Working?

**Check logs:**
```bash
python company_scrapers.py
```

This runs the test suite for all scrapers.

**Common issues:**
1. **API changes** - Companies update their APIs periodically
2. **Rate limiting** - Too many requests too quickly
3. **Network errors** - Connection timeouts
4. **HTML structure changes** - For web scrapers (Meta, Tesla)

### Google Scraper Returns 0 Jobs

- Check if the feed URL is accessible: https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/jobs/feed.xml
- Feed is very large (10MB+), may timeout
- Try with keywords to filter results

### Amazon/Apple Scrapers Fail

- These companies may have more strict API protections
- May require specific headers or user agents
- Consider adjusting timeout and retry settings

## Future Enhancements

### Companies to Add

- **Netflix** - careers.netflix.com
- **NVIDIA** - nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com
- **Salesforce** - salesforce.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com
- **Oracle** - oracle.com/careers
- **IBM** - ibm.com/careers
- **Adobe** - adobe.com/careers
- **Uber** - uber.com/careers
- **Airbnb** - airbnb.com/careers
- **Stripe** - stripe.com/jobs
- **Shopify** - shopify.com/careers

### Improvements

- **Caching** - Cache company feeds to reduce API calls
- **Webhooks** - Get notified when new jobs are posted
- **Filters** - More advanced filtering (experience level, salary range)
- **Alerts** - Email/SMS when specific jobs are posted

## Statistics

After scraping companies, check stats:

```bash
curl https://web-production-94ca.up.railway.app/stats
```

You'll see:
```json
{
  "total_jobs": 2500,
  "by_source": {
    "google": 150,
    "amazon": 200,
    "apple": 80,
    ...
  }
}
```
